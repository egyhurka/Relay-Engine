# OpenGL 3D Game Project

This project is an exploration into the world of OpenGL, with the ultimate goal of developing an immersive 3D game environment. Currently, the application enables users to navigate freely through an empty space while generating millions of distinct shapes, including cubes, according to specified volume parameters. Each generated shape supports customizable color attributes, allowing for vibrant visual diversity.

## 🚀 Features
- Generate millions of shapes (e.g., cubes, spheres) in specified volumes.
- Random or customizable color for each generated shape.
- Basic movement mechanics within a 3D environment.
